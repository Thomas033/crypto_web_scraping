       "\"Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.\\nHappy Fourth of July to all who celebrate! Hope you’re lucky enough to have time off. Spend some of it doing something you love.\\nThis is the last of a three-part newsletter series about the risks facing crypto right now.\\nHere are the three topics this newsletter series covers.\\nPrice and macro risk (two weeks ago)\\nPlatform and protocol risk (last week)\\nPublic company risk (this week)\\nThis week we’ll take a look at public company risk.\\nPublic companies are widely misunderstood, especially among the bitcoin and crypto crowd. That’s not really surprising. The whole thing is (enter: 100% of my cynicism) intentionally convoluted and confusing to make the investment bankers, lawyers and insiders on Wall Street feel smart.\\nI mean, these are called “public companies,” but they are decidedly private, for-profit enterprises. Words matter, but just not in high finance, apparently.\\n– George Kaloudis\\nFor context, I want to lay out what it means to “go public” or “be a public company.” A company goes public by selling some or all of its equity to a group of underwriters, who then issue stock to trade openly on exchanges like the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange.\\nYou’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.\\nIt’s “public” in that (almost) anyone can invest in this equity freely (in practice, it isn’t truly open). Also its financial information – from quarterly income statements to stock price – is publicly shared. Companies do this to receive an injection of money to aid growth or reward long-time equity holders and have easier access to future capital. These seem to be reasonable reasons to go public, and a lot of the time it works out.\\nBut for more context, I’m going to tell you what I think about going public.\\nStory continues\""

       "'In a press release, MEXC Global said they are opening up users in over 180 countries to conveniently and cheaply buy crypto assets worth up to $5k in a single transaction.\\nAccording to the Head of Payment at MEXC Global, Anthony Guo, the decision is because they want to simplify and create a “connected user experience”.\\n“By enabling crypto purchase through Visa and MasterCard directly, MEXC Global is delivering a faster, simpler, and more connected experience for its users — making it easier for users to convert fiat into crypto assets, which opens up the ownership of cryptocurrency to millions of people where bank card is the dominant medium of transaction.”\\nMEXC Global is actively opening up more channels for fiat holders to acquire their favorite crypto assets using an easy-to-use and familiar payment method they are comfortable with. Despite the explosion of crypto and blockchain-enabled payment and remittance ramps, Visa, MasterCard, and other traditional payment options are used by fiat holders spread across the globe.\\nThese payment processors have refined their operations over the years. Notably, they have a more robust, global network of partners, primarily financial institutions. On the other hand, crypto solutions are still being developed and lagging. MEXC Global is filling this gap by linking the crypto and fiat worlds to fast-track the adoption of digital assets. This specifically considers the massive cost benefits associated with digital asset infrastructure.\\nMEXC Global and its newfound partners, MasterCard and Visa, realize what’s at stake. They are now committing to driving crypto adoption in a win-win arrangement. While MEXC Global will increase its user base and Visa and MasterCard profit from fees, end-users, on the other hand, can quickly shuttle between the fiat and crypto worlds without necessarily learning or familiarizing themselves with complex systems.\\nThe partnership follows the successful launch of the Global Bank Transfer Program that allows MEXC Global clients in Europe and the U.S. to deposit and withdraw using SWIFT and FedWire networks. Users who purchase crypto through the program also don’t pay trading fees.\\nMEXC Global has also launched an OTC payment service and activated P2P trading. Moreover, clients can use approved third-party portals like Simplex and Banxa.\\n '"

       "\"Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12.\\nHappy Fourth of July to all who celebrate! Hope you’re lucky enough to have time off. Spend some of it doing something you love.\\nThis is the last of a three-part newsletter series about the risks facing crypto right now.\\nHere are the three topics this newsletter series covers.\\nPrice and macro risk (two weeks ago)\\nPlatform and protocol risk (last week)\\nPublic company risk (this week)\\nThis week we’ll take a look at public company risk.\\nPublic companies are widely misunderstood, especially among the bitcoin and crypto crowd. That’s not really surprising. The whole thing is (enter: 100% of my cynicism) intentionally convoluted and confusing to make the investment bankers, lawyers and insiders on Wall Street feel smart.\\nI mean, these are called “public companies,” but they are decidedly private, for-profit enterprises. Words matter, but just not in high finance, apparently.\\n– George Kaloudis\\nFor context, I want to lay out what it means to “go public” or “be a public company.” A company goes public by selling some or all of its equity to a group of underwriters, who then issue stock to trade openly on exchanges like the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange.\\nYou’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.\\nIt’s “public” in that (almost) anyone can invest in this equity freely (in practice, it isn’t truly open). Also its financial information – from quarterly income statements to stock price – is publicly shared. Companies do this to receive an injection of money to aid growth or reward long-time equity holders and have easier access to future capital. These seem to be reasonable reasons to go public, and a lot of the time it works out.\\nBut for more context, I’m going to tell you what I think about going public.\\nStory continues\""

       "'fdic crypto exchanges\\nOne of the benefits of using cryptocurrency is the anonymity you receive through transactions. Unfortunately, this is also one of the main reasons that most exchanges offer no FDIC protection. This means that if the crypto exchange loses your dollar reserves, you have no protection. However, a few exchanges do participate by holding dollar reserves in an FDIC-insured bank. With those exchanges, if you lose your money on deposit the FDIC will reimburse those losses up to the program’s cap.\\nIf you’re looking to hold large dollar amounts in an exchange you may want to first speak to a financial advisor who can help you plan accordingly.\\nWhat Is the FDIC?\\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, better known as the FDIC, is a program that insures cash deposits in bank accounts. It was created in the wake of the Great Depression when panicked customers rushed to take their money out of banks for fear of losing those deposits. Since banks use the money they hold on deposits to operate, a bank rush can put the entire institution out of business and leave customers with nothing.\\nTo keep this from happening again the government now insures bank deposits. If your bank goes out of business or otherwise runs out of money, the government will reimburse any lost funds from your checking or savings accounts. This insurance covers up to $250,000 in losses per person per bank, and only applies to U.S. dollars held by licensed U.S. banks that pay into the FDIC’s insurance program.\\nCritically this means that the FDIC does not protect foreign currency or investment assets. If you have dollars in a checking or savings account and your bank loses the money, the FDIC will cover those losses. If you hold a stock portfolio and the market crashes, the government won’t make you whole.\\nDoes the FDIC Insure Cryptocurrency?\\nfdic crypto exchanges\\nThe FDIC does not protect cryptocurrency because it considers crypto investment assets, not money. Even if the government changes its position on that issue, the FDIC only insures U.S. dollars. The result is that if you hold cryptocurrency like Bitcoins, Ethereum, Dogecoin or any other similar assets, the FDIC treats them like investment assets. It does not reimburse you for any losses, including:\\nLost value of existing coins if the value of individual tokens in your portfolio declines;\\nLost coins themselves if the number of tokens in your portfolio declines.\\nSo, for example, say that you have a portfolio with a cryptocurrency exchange. The exchange is hacked and thieves steal your cryptocurrency tokens, or perhaps the exchange goes out of business and can no longer honor your cryptocurrency tokens. The FDIC will not reimburse you for these losses.\\nHowever, the FDIC might insure the U.S. dollars that you hold in a cryptocurrency exchange. Typically, this will be the case for exchanges that hold customer funds in FDIC insured banks. This means that the exchange doesn’t hold the money itself. Instead, any dollars in your account are held by a third-party bank and moved as necessary when you buy and sell cryptocurrencies.\\nAs a result, it’s more technically accurate to say that some cryptocurrency exchanges hold their money in U.S., FDIC insured banks rather than that the FDIC covers some cryptocurrency exchanges.\\nThis has become increasingly important in recent months. As the cryptocurrency market has lost billions, several projects and even entire exchanges have gone out of business. If you have money on deposit in an unprotected exchange you might lose not only your cryptocurrency but also any U.S. dollars you had in that account.

      "One of the benefits of using cryptocurrency is the anonymity you receive through transactions. Unfortunately, this is also one of the main reasons that most exchanges offer no FDIC protection. This means that if the crypto exchange loses your dollar reserves, you have no protection. However, a few exchanges do participate by holding dollar reserves in an FDIC-insured bank. With those exchanges, if you lose your money on deposit the FDIC will reimburse those losses up to the program’s cap.\n",
      "If you’re looking to hold large dollar amounts in an exchange you may want to first speak to a financial advisor who can help you plan accordingly.\n",
      "What Is the FDIC?\n",
      "The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, better known as the FDIC, is a program that insures cash deposits in bank accounts. It was created in the wake of the Great Depression when panicked customers rushed to take their money out of banks for fear of losing those deposits. Since banks use the money they hold on deposits to operate, a bank rush can put the entire institution out of business and leave customers with nothing.\n",
      "To keep this from happening again the government now insures bank deposits. If your bank goes out of business or otherwise runs out of money, the government will reimburse any lost funds from your checking or savings accounts. This insurance covers up to $250,000 in losses per person per bank, and only applies to U.S. dollars held by licensed U.S. banks that pay into the FDIC’s insurance program.\n",
      "Critically this means that the FDIC does not protect foreign currency or investment assets. If you have dollars in a checking or savings account and your bank loses the money, the FDIC will cover those losses. If you hold a stock portfolio and the market crashes, the government won’t make you whole.\n",
      "Does the FDIC Insure Cryptocurrency?\n",
      "fdic crypto exchanges\n",
      "The FDIC does not protect cryptocurrency because it considers crypto investment assets, not money. Even if the government changes its position on that issue, the FDIC only insures U.S. dollars. The result is that if you hold cryptocurrency like Bitcoins, Ethereum, Dogecoin or any other similar assets, the FDIC treats them like investment assets. It does not reimburse you for any losses, including:\n",
      "Lost value of existing coins if the value of individual tokens in your portfolio declines;\n",
      "Lost coins themselves if the number of tokens in your portfolio declines.\n",
      "So, for example, say that you have a portfolio with a cryptocurrency exchange. The exchange is hacked and thieves steal your cryptocurrency tokens, or perhaps the exchange goes out of business and can no longer honor your cryptocurrency tokens. The FDIC will not reimburse you for these losses.\n",
      "However, the FDIC might insure the U.S. dollars that you hold in a cryptocurrency exchange. Typically, this will be the case for exchanges that hold customer funds in FDIC insured banks. This means that the exchange doesn’t hold the money itself. Instead, any dollars in your account are held by a third-party bank and moved as necessary when you buy and sell cryptocurrencies.\n",
      "As a result, it’s more technically accurate to say that some cryptocurrency exchanges hold their money in U.S., FDIC insured banks rather than that the FDIC covers some cryptocurrency exchanges.\n",
      "This has become increasingly important in recent months. As the cryptocurrency market has lost billions, several projects and even entire exchanges have gone out of business. If you have money on deposit in an unprotected exchange you might lose not only your cryptocurrency but also any U.S. dollars you had in that account. If your exchange uses an FDIC-protected bank, on the other hand, you are protected up to the FDIC’s limit of $250,000 per person.\n",
